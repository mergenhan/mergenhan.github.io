# Internal Product Management

When developing products as a product manager, you have to understand the problem, clearly communicate the value, and ensure people get things done.

Likewise, you have to do these when developing an internal product, no different from an external product. The only difference is that your users also happen to be your teammates. When I found out that I was going to be a product manager for the internal product at my company, I first researched related blogs and podcasts. As a result of the research, I noted the transfer of knowledge and experience, but as always, the theory and practice were different. In this article, I would like to write about the techniques I applied and my conclusions. But first of all, ***I would like to thank all my colleagues who supported me during this process and guided me where I got stuck.*** And I would like to point out; I will only write about my thoughts and inferences in this article. None of it is objective knowledge, just experience, and deduction.

In my opinion, as a Product Manager building an internal product, you have certain advantages:

- Your "customers" are only one message or desk away.
- You know the organization structure and which team is in charge of what.
- You can see people's backgrounds and schedules.

Noticing these benefits early on, uber also explains in [its article](https://eng.uber.com/it-engineering-meet-the-team-that-keeps-uber-moving), employees are treated as customers.

## Understanding of Product Value
Internal or External, the product should solve a problem. Therefore, you must first understand the context, the persona, and the problem of the customer, actually your colleague :). Firstly, When I started to build the internal product, I initially had a group or one-to-one meetings with all my customers and only listened to them. I learned their day-to-day operations to understand and put myself in their personas. During this study, thanks to my cyber security background, I quickly completed this step.
Meanwhile, I often talked and presented my analysis result to the engineer's team.  If we were to develop a product as a team, they should know the persona who would use the product and its value for the persona. That was the purpose of our meetings.
> One of the most important things I learned at this step is that if you can convey to people how valuable the developed product is, the resulting product is successful at that level.

## Internal Stakeholders
The other meaningful way of building the right products for internal stakeholders that ı learn is to become the stakeholder. There's no better way to understand the problems your customers face than to experience the pain yourself. Before important releases, 
> Get stakeholders involved in the QA part of the product development process. 

For this, I set weekly meetings to inform them about the process with the teams. We talked to the teams about the release and testing process. When an important decision was needed that block development, I would gather the stakeholders and quickly decide.

## Product Security
Another critical point is internal product security. Internal products can be limited access, but generally, they may have more critical data or information. Failure to apply the same tight security standards to our internal products can create loopholes for attackers, so it pays to take security seriously for internal and externally facing tools. Since the beginning of development, we have worked with security teams and create security rules. To apply these security tools ı worked with more than one team like DevOps, Engineering, etc.

## Inform the Company
Release notes are published on external products. In the same way, in internal products, writing a release document to inform all teams is essential. Since we were in close contact with the relevant teams at the first stage, we did not feel this need. But I want to create this release document after the product progresses. I want to prepare a release note document for the relevant teams in 2 weeks. This document will contain information about what was added to the product in 2 weeks, which bugs were fixed, and what will do in the next two weeks. This way, I hope to communicate our plans and challenges. 

## Feature Requests & Bugs
I think that 
> A user should contribute to the product to own the product.

For this reason, we asked customers to convey their new feature requests and bugs they encountered while using the product. It is essential for us to understand customers' new needs. For this, we used an excel sheet at the beginning. We took the ideas and bugs from there and reviewed&analyzed them with engineering teams. After that, we responded quickly. I can say that 
> This mutual exchange of ideas has contributed significantly to the flow and development of the product.

## Old Habits Die Hard 
What makes a product a product is that customers can use it. So, what is important is that it can somehow encourage users to use the product. Users may prefer to go the way they know and use the product they have experienced. Therefore, we need to attract users to the product. In addition to adding features that they could not do in the past and that made their process more manageable, they should believe that the new product was working correctly. Almost all of what I wrote above contributed to this process. Our customers really need the new product, so we didn't have any trouble with this step.  Besides the above, I frequently met with my colleagues in the customer team and excitedly explained the product's new features to them. We first developed those features by learning what was wrong with the old product and which generally used component. Thus, it was not difficult for us to familiarize the customer with the new product. 

***As a summary;***
> If you have teams targeting the same goals, you can create desired products together with understanding, patience, and effort
