# MITRE ATT&CK Model

>“MITRE ATT&CK™ is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. ATT&CK is open and available to any person or organization for use at no charge.”

Firstly cyber kill chain and attack life cycle was developed but these structures are high level and have not any material for using easily. So MITRE developed the ATTA&CK model for this gap. MITRE ATT&CK can be useful when track adversary behavior at a detailed level and to communicate with defenders and with other organizations about specific behaviors in a common language.

As you can see below MITRE ATT&CK has 2 phase. PRE-ATT&CK framework which covers tactics and techniques pre-compromise what attackers before exploiting target network. But the Enterprise ATT&CK framework has 11 tactics.



To compare with cyber kill chain, PRE-ATT&CK mostly collate with the first three phases of the kill chain: reconnaissance, weaponization, and delivery. ATT&CK Enterprise collate well with the final four phases of the kill chain: exploitation, installation, command & control, and actions on objectives.

The aim of the ATT&CK framework is to improve post-compromise detection of adversaries in enterprises by illustrating the actions an attacker may have taken. This framework answer like question, How did the attacker get in? , How are they moving around? ATT&CK stand for Adversarial techniques, tactics and common knowledge. It is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

Tactics are the what attackers are trying to achieve whereas the individual techniques are the how they accomplish those steps or goals. When looking at ATT&CK in the form of a matrix, the column titles across the top are tactics and are essentially categories of techniques.

A technique is a specific behavior to achieve aim and is often a single step in a string of activities employed to complete the attacker’s overall mission. ATT&CK provides many details about each technique including a description, examples, references, and suggestions for mitigation and detection.

As a summary, we can mentioned ATT&CK in this way. In future post will be explained in more detail later.
