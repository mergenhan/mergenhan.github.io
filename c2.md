# Quick Introduce to Cloud Security

In 2020 the Cloud Security Alliance released a top threat report, which identifies and describes 11 significant threats to Cloud[1]. The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is one of the first nonprofit organizations that have tried to set up standards for best practices for secure cloud computing. They further try to offer guidance and security education. New threats have been added to the report that were not shown in previous reports. These issues and threats are inherently specific to the cloud and thus indicate a technology landscape where consumers are actively considering cloud migration. Such topics refer to potential control plane weaknesses, metastructure, and applistructure failures, and limited cloud visibility. For more detail please check out the report.

Threats according to the criticality level are as follows:

## 1. Data Breaches

> A data breach is a cybersecurity incident where sensitive, protected 
or confidential information is released, viewed, stolen or used by an 
unauthorized individual. 

Data are becoming the main target of cyber attacks. Therefore, it is in the same position in the data breach 2020 report, which is the most critical threat in previous reports. The threat, which affects reputation and financial impact as well as trust, can occur in all cloud service models. Security responsibility for this threat belongs to cloud service provider and customer.

According to the report, data is the main target of cyber attackers. Therefore, it is important to define the criticality level of the data and determine who can access the data.
Data in cloud environments are most vulnerable to misconfiguration and exploitation. Therefore, even if various encryption techniques are used, these techniques may adversely affect performance or process. A robust and well-tested incident response plan that considers the CSP and data privacy laws will help data breach victims recover. 


## 2. Misconfiguration and Inadequate Change Control

Misconfiguration of cloud resources is a leading cause of data breaches and could allow deletion or modification of resources and service interruption. Excessive permissions, Default credentials and configuration settings left unchanged are some of the known mimsconfiguraation examples. But an absence of effective change control is a common cause of misconfiguration in a cloud environment. 

Because cloud environments are different from traditional IT environments, their configurations and security understanding are also different.
Since cloud computing is a newer technology compared to traditional IT environments, there is also a lack of knowledge and experience in users.

> In traditional IT environments, people owned large servers and all the responsibility of the servers belonged to the users. But with cloud computing, users only rent servers. Cloud service providers undertake many of the hardware or software responsibilities of the servers.

In fact, according to this mindset, speed and dynamism are very important in cloud environments.

## 3. Lack of Cloud Security Architecture and Strategy

With the increasing advantages of cloud environments, many organizations are rapidly migrating to cloud environments. The biggest problem in this rapid migration is to have a cloud architecture and strategy that can withstand cyber attacks.
Since many organizations lack these, they are moved to the cloud environment as vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Afterwards, when faced with cyberattacks, they stop using the cloud by saying that the ***cloud environments are insecure***. 

No matter how big or small the enterprise, proper security architecture and strategy are required elements for securely moving, deploying and operating in the cloud. 

## 4. Insufficient Identity, Credential, Access and Key Management

Cloud computing introduces multiple changes to traditional  internal system management practices related to identity and  access management (IAM). These systems include tools  and policies that allow organizations to manage, monitor and  secure access to valuable resources like virtual machines, databases, storages etc. In fact, these systems are not very new, but their criticality levels have increased with the use of the cloud. Because, any misconfigurations in these systems, affect your all cloud environment like issues on control plane , data exfiltration etc.

## 5. Account Hijacking 

Gain of a highly privileged or sensitive account by attackers is called account hijacking. Likewise, high privileged accounts in cloud environments involve high risk. Attackers use Phishing attacks, exploitation of cloud-based systems, or stolen credentials to compromise these accounts. Account Hijacking is a threat that must be taken seriously and isn’t just a password reset. These threats results include data leaks that lead to reputational damage, reduced brand equity, exposure to legal liabilities, and disclosure of sensitive personal and business information.

## 6. Insider Threat
According to CISA, 
> An insider is any person who has or had authorized access to or knowledge of an organization’s resources, including personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, and systems. 

These attackers who are called insiders, can be current or former employees, contractors, or other trusted business partners. Unlike external threat actors, insiders do not have to penetrate security defenses. According to CSA report, insider negligence is the cause of most security incidents. To prevent insider threats, companies should train their regular teams and security teams, fix misconfigurations in cloud services, configure them with a zero-trust perspective, and control their employees' access access. 

## 7. Insecure Interfaces and APIs

APIs and UIs are often the most exposed parts of a system as a ***Front Door***. The security and availability of services in the cloud depend on API security. At the same time, APIs and UIs are often the attack surfaces most easily accessible to an attacker. Poorly designed APIs could lead to misuse or—even worse—a data breach. 

## 8. Weak Control Plane

I have mentioned the keyword of control plain and data plain in my  [previous articles](https://mergenhan.github.io/c1.html). In an environment has a misconfigurations on control plane, full management of the cloud system is just as these misconfigurations. Because inaccessible sides can be found and these inaccessible sides get some limitations for cloud admins. These limitations could result in data corruption, unavailability, or leakage by attackers

## 9. Metastructure and Applistructure Failures

Metastructure and Applistructure Failures is another threat that was reported in 2020. Cloud service providers routinely reveal operations and security  protections that are necessary to implement and protect their systems successfully. To defend this threat, cloud users must understand how to properly implement cloud applications to fully utilize the cloud platform. 

## 10. Limited Cloud Usage Visibility

The fact that users can not control their inventory in cloud environments is called limited cloud usage visibility. This threat occurs when an organization does not possess the ability to visualize and analyze whether cloud service use within the organization is safe or malicious. This threat occurs 3 lack as; Lack of governance, lack of awareness, lack of security.

## 11. Abuse and Nefarious Use of Cloud Services

CSP are known to have weak registration processes and therefore can give easy access to attackers. Possible impacts include decoding and cracking of passwords and executing malicious commands. Attackers may leverage cloud computing resources to 
target users, organizations or other cloud providers. They can also host malware on cloud services and these services can seem more legitimate because the malware uses the CSP’s domain. In this scope, CSPs must have some responsibilities like incident response team, track payment and fraud, etc.
